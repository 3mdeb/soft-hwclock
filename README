A fake hardwareclock for systemd based systems.
Useful, for example, for Raspberry PI systems running CentOS.

Sets the time to a "recent" timestamp early in the boot to avoid timestamps
far in the past when booting, prior to getting a proper timestamp from the network.

- Stores and saves the realtime clock in a file at start and shutdown.
- Regularly saves the current time into the data file, in case of improper shutdown.
- shell based to avoid platform and binary dependencies.

Installation:
	1) copy these files into /opt/fake-hwclock/
        2) install the services using "bash /opt/fake-hwclock/install"
	3) enable and start service: "systemctl enable fake-hwclock.service && systemctl start fake-hwclock.service"
